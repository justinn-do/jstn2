  <h1>
    I am no beast from ancient lands,
    I am not giant tusks within the sands.
    I shy away from the mammoth downstairs,
    In a place where people less care.
    <br><br>
    Enclosed in glass, there is I who stretch with dare,
    My spine and head stand tall and bare.
    Not a reptile or bird but something cute,
    Some of my kind like to eat fruit.
    <br><br>
    In the buildings where fossil teach,
    Exist extinct creatures that are almost within reach.
    There displays a chicken that clucks at a frog that croaks at the rat, 
    I myself look down on all of them for I am the ___.
